Argeo Build is a minimalistic Java build system based on GNU make, which is meant to be used as a git submodule of a software layer following Argeo's conventions. It is using Java files directly as scripts, without prior compilation.

It is NOT meant as a generic Java build system.

## Components
Argeo Build depends on the Eclipse ECJ Java compiler, and on the BND Tools library for OSGi metadata generation (and therefore on SLF4j).

- osgi.mk			is included in the root Makefile of the layer being built
- configure			configures a build environment
- Make.java			compiles Java code and creates OSGi bundles based on the bnd.bnd file of each project within the layer
- Repackage.java	downloads and repackages as OSGi bundles Maven artifacts or Eclipse releases (cf. Argeo TP)

## Usage
For example usage, look at one of the core Argeo layers (typically Argeo Commons) on http://git.argeo.org :

git clone http://git.argeo.org/lgpl/argeo-commons.git --recursive
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64/
./argeo-commons/configure
cd argeo-commons
make clean all manifests

Argeo Build will be installed as a git submodule under ./sdk/argeo-build/.
